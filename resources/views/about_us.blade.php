            <p>We group of like-minded investors from Bangalore, India. We are engineers by profession and working in reputed MNCs. So, this is not our primary source of income. We are practicing Muslims and believe in halal-way of earning our living.
                <br><br>
                We founded this blog out of our passion towards Indian Stock market & investing in Halal businesses. We want to help others identify/invest in interest-free asset class.
                <br><br>
                We started our stock market investing journey in 2016. Our aim is to spread awareness towards halal investing & educate our readers towards value investing.
                <br><br>
                We have to grow our savings to beat inflation. See the chart below from World Bank, on inflation in India which is in the range of 6-8% (average). If we want to grow our savings in halal way, there are only few options available such as real estate, gold or starting own business. All these options have their advantages & disadvantages. However, the return on investment (ROI) provided by stock market is much higher than that of other asset class over the long term.

            <p>Whenever we hear the term stock market, many people are scared and think of it as place where people gamble. We wanted to break this myth and educate such people.
                <br><br>
                Other problem we see today is stock market investors do not see the returns in their portfolio even though indices (Sensex & Nifty) create new records. The reason behind is the charges paid by investors to banks, MF, money managers etc.
                We want you to learn how to analyze a company, its business model, customers, financials and management. Decide on whether you want to own part of the business. We believe, if investor analyzes many companies, one day he/she will find a company that is worth owning for a long time. Eventually stock market will recognize & reward such companies by increasing their share prices.
                <br><br>
                We will help you in identifying the companies with good business model, healthy balance sheet, good profitability & moats (if any). We will also analyse managementâ€™s ability to grow the business, past misdeeds (if any) so that you are careful.
                <br><br>
                We collect collate information about companies and present in condensed report for people who are not keen on reading lengthy annual report or do not understand financial jargon.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let us prove that
                <ul>
                    <li> Interest (fixed/compound) is not the only way to grow your money. </li>
                    <li> Stock market investing is not only for Charted Accountants, Economics professional or professional money managers </li>
                    <li> Halal way of investing is more peaceful approach </li>
                    <li> We can differentiate between good & bad businesses </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>We have companies in our portfolio whose stock prices have reached 3x and we also have companies whos stock prices have gone almost zero. The reason for mentioning this is we learn from our mistake. One of the learnings from our mistake was to develop invest-framework and stick to it. Now we have only those companies that fit our investing framework and run by an able management.
                <br><br>
                We charge for our service to keep this website to cover the expenses of running this blog, keeping it ad-free and provide value for your money.
